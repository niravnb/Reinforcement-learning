Report is placed in current folder.


Code is placed in "Code" folder. It has three folders:
1. "Q1_Q_learning_Sarsa" contains code for Q1
2. "Q2_Policy_Gradient" folder contains code for Q2
3. "numpy saves" it contains stored files for numpy arrays, which were used for plotting different plots. It also have four subfolder one for each algorithm.


"Extra Plots" folder contains some extra plots like 
1. showing performance for each goal individually for both Sarsa & Q-learning 
2. optimal policies for Sarsa(lambda) for all values of lambda
3. "PG Experiments" contains more experiments empirical results like iterations, average return, value of parameter $ \theta $ for different setting of hyperparameters for both problems chakra and vishamC.


"Videos of trained agents" folder contains video of agent playing for 10 episodes along with optimal policies shown for each state after learning from 3000 episodes for all three goals & for Q-learning and Sarsa.
